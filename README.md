### A Stateful Component (stateful-component.html)
In addition to taking input data (accessed via this.props), a component can maintain internal state data (accessed via this.state). When a componentâ€™s state data changes, the rendered markup will be updated by re-invoking render().

### Input Binding (input-binding.html)
Bind the value to a state variable on an onChange event to change the state as the input value changes.
